# VSL language parser

Project I did myself for college courses.

This project is a parser for the VSL language.

Your VSL program is parsed into LLVM IR which will compile your code in a machine code.

The project is incomplete as one feature is missing : table as function parameter

Due to the missing of this feature some test actually don't pass.
